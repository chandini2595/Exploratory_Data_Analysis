**Assignment 1:**
Complete dataset EDA in colab (preferably using D3.js visualizations). Pick a complex dataset from kaggle. Please push to limits and demonstrate advanced d3.js visualizations

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science process used to understand the structure and relationships in the data before applying machine learning models or statistical techniques. The goal of EDA is to help data scientists and analysts make sense of the data, identify patterns, detect outliers, and clean the data for more effective modeling.

EDA steps:

  1.	Load Data: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
  2.	Check Missing Data: Identify missing values and decide how to handle them.
  3.	Check for Duplicates: Detect and remove any duplicate rows.
  4.	Descriptive Statistics: Use summary statistics to understand numerical columns.
  5.	Outlier Detection: Identify outliers using boxplots or statistical methods.
  6.	Univariate Analysis: Visualize distributions of individual features using histograms.
  7.	Bivariate Analysis: Analyze relationships between two features using scatter plots or boxplots.
  8.	Correlation Analysis: Compute the correlation matrix and visualize it with heatmaps.
  9.	Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones.
  10.	Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical variables into numerical form using encoding.
