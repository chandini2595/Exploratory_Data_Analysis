**Assignment 1:**
Complete dataset EDA in colab (preferably using D3.js visualizations). Pick a complex dataset from kaggle. Please push to limits and demonstrate advanced d3.js visualizations

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science process used to understand the structure and relationships in the data before applying machine learning models or statistical techniques. The goal of EDA is to help data scientists and analysts make sense of the data, identify patterns, detect outliers, and clean the data for more effective modeling.

EDA steps:

  1.	Load Data: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
  2.	Check Missing Data: Identify missing values and decide how to handle them.
  3.	Check for Duplicates: Detect and remove any duplicate rows.
  4.	Descriptive Statistics: Use summary statistics to understand numerical columns.
  5.	Outlier Detection: Identify outliers using boxplots or statistical methods.
  6.	Univariate Analysis: Visualize distributions of individual features using histograms.
  7.	Bivariate Analysis: Analyze relationships between two features using scatter plots or boxplots.
  8.	Correlation Analysis: Compute the correlation matrix and visualize it with heatmaps.
  9.	Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones.
  10.	Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical variables into numerical form using encoding.

**Assignment 2** - Auto EDA with your favorite tool. Pick your favorite kaggle data set and favorite auto eda tool (like pandas profiler or sweetviz etc.,.) Do auto eda using one of the tools i discussed in the class which is your favorite. make it very appealing for viewers.

Auto EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) refers to the automated process of analyzing datasets to understand their main characteristics quickly and efficiently. It involves generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, identifying missing values, and detecting correlations. Auto EDA tools like pandas-profiling, Sweetviz, and D-Tale automate these steps, saving time compared to manual exploration. These tools produce comprehensive reports with minimal coding, making them ideal for data preparation and initial insights. Auto EDA is widely used to prepare datasets before feature engineering or model building.

Here are the steps for Auto EDA, in one line each:

1. Install the Auto EDA tool: Install tools like pandas-profiling or Sweetviz.
2. Import necessary libraries: Import pandas and the chosen Auto EDA tool.
3. Load the dataset: Use pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
4. Generate the report: Use the toolâ€™s analyze or profile_report function to create the EDA report.
5. Visualize and export: View the report in an interactive format or export it as HTML for further analysis.
