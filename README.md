**Data engineering colab and apache beam or apache spark colab**

**Assignment 1:**
Complete dataset EDA in colab (preferably using D3.js visualizations). Pick a complex dataset from kaggle. Please push to limits and demonstrate advanced d3.js visualizations

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science process used to understand the structure and relationships in the data before applying machine learning models or statistical techniques. The goal of EDA is to help data scientists and analysts make sense of the data, identify patterns, detect outliers, and clean the data for more effective modeling.

EDA steps:

  1.	Load Data: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure.
  2.	Check Missing Data: Identify missing values and decide how to handle them.
  3.	Check for Duplicates: Detect and remove any duplicate rows.
  4.	Descriptive Statistics: Use summary statistics to understand numerical columns.
  5.	Outlier Detection: Identify outliers using boxplots or statistical methods.
  6.	Univariate Analysis: Visualize distributions of individual features using histograms.
  7.	Bivariate Analysis: Analyze relationships between two features using scatter plots or boxplots.
  8.	Correlation Analysis: Compute the correlation matrix and visualize it with heatmaps.
  9.	Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones.
  10.	Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical variables into numerical form using encoding.

**Assignment 2** - Auto EDA with your favorite tool. Pick your favorite kaggle data set and favorite auto eda tool (like pandas profiler or sweetviz etc.,.) Do auto eda using one of the tools i discussed in the class which is your favorite. make it very appealing for viewers.

Auto EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) refers to the automated process of analyzing datasets to understand their main characteristics quickly and efficiently. It involves generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, identifying missing values, and detecting correlations. Auto EDA tools like pandas-profiling, Sweetviz, and D-Tale automate these steps, saving time compared to manual exploration. These tools produce comprehensive reports with minimal coding, making them ideal for data preparation and initial insights. Auto EDA is widely used to prepare datasets before feature engineering or model building.

Here are the steps for Auto EDA, in one line each:

1. Install the Auto EDA tool: Install tools like pandas-profiling or Sweetviz.
2. Import necessary libraries: Import pandas and the chosen Auto EDA tool.
3. Load the dataset: Use pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
4. Generate the report: Use the tool’s analyze or profile_report function to create the EDA report.
5. Visualize and export: View the report in an interactive format or export it as HTML for further analysis.

**Assignment 3** - Apache beam features - Demonstrate apache beam in a colab including composite transform, pipeline io, triggers, windowing ,pardo and streaming.

Apache Beam is an open-source, unified programming model designed for defining and executing data processing pipelines, which can handle both batch and streaming data. It provides an abstraction layer that allows developers to write pipelines once and execute them on various distributed processing backends (known as “runners”), such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.

How Apache Beam is Used:

1. Pipeline Creation: You define a pipeline to transform data, starting with data ingestion and ending with data output.
2. Transforms: You apply various transforms like Map, GroupByKey, and Windowing to process data.
3. Runners: Once defined, the pipeline can be run on different execution engines by specifying the runner (e.g., Spark, Dataflow).
4. Streaming and Batch: Apache Beam supports both real-time (streaming) and historical (batch) data processing.
5. Scalability: It is used to process large-scale data with built-in windowing, triggers, and parallel processing capabilities.

Beam is ideal for building scalable data processing workflows that run on multiple cloud platforms or on-premises environments.

Key concepts in Apache Beam:

1. Composite Transform:

	•	A Composite Transform is a higher-level transform made up of multiple lower-level transforms. It allows you to bundle a series of operations into a single reusable block of code.
	•	Example: You can create a ProcessText composite transform that first converts text to uppercase, then removes special characters, and finally tokenizes it.

2. Pipeline I/O:

	•	Pipeline Input/Output (I/O) refers to how Apache Beam reads and writes data. Apache Beam supports various I/O connectors to read from and write to data sources like text files, databases, message queues (e.g., Kafka, Pub/Sub), and cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage).
	•	Example: ReadFromText() to read from a file and WriteToText() to write the output to a file.

3. Triggers:

	•	Triggers control when data is emitted in streaming pipelines, especially when working with windowed data. They dictate how often results from a window are emitted, based on factors like processing time or data arrival.
	•	Example: A trigger can be set to fire after every 2 seconds of data processing, even if the window is still open.

4. Windowing:

	•	Windowing divides the data stream into logical chunks, or windows, for processing. It allows operations to be applied over finite sets of data in a streaming pipeline.
	•	Example: Fixed windows group data into 5-minute intervals, allowing you to compute metrics on each 5-minute window of incoming data.

5. ParDo:

	•	ParDo (Parallel Do) is a parallel processing primitive in Apache Beam. It allows element-wise transformations of data in a parallel manner. It’s a flexible mechanism for processing elements in a PCollection.
	•	Example: A ParDo transform might clean up or enrich each element in the dataset in parallel using a custom function.

6. Streaming:

	•	Streaming in Apache Beam refers to real-time, unbounded data processing. It handles data that continuously flows in, unlike batch processing which deals with finite data. Streaming pipelines process data as it arrives, using tools like windowing and triggers.
	•	Example: A streaming pipeline could ingest data from a real-time source like Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Apache Kafka and process it continuously.

These concepts are integral to building scalable and flexible data processing pipelines in Apache Beam.
